## NAME

__rsfp__ - build R packages from only one file.
 
## SYNOPSIS

```
Rscript rsfp-src.R
cd rsfp 
R CMD build .
R CMD check rsfp_0.0.1.tar.gz
R CND INSTALL rsfp_0.0.1.tar.gz
```

## DESCRIPTION

Single file approch for R packages. Build your R package from a single file.
The source file  contains the files  required to build a package in a single R
script  where the  different  files are marked  within R comments. A rsfp file
has FILE marks  embedded  with the source  file to  indicate  where a new file
starts.  During  processing  these  files are  created in the current  working
directory.

## BACKGROUND

Creating  R  packages  is a  laborius  approach.  You  need to have a  certain
directory  structure,  files  like  NAMESPACE  and  DESCRIPTION  and the users
usually jumps between these different files around and has to do the neccesary
edits to get a starting package. Although it is recommended for my students to
start for their  projects by  collecting  their code in  packages,  due to the
complicated  techniques they usually end up with a unorganized collection of R
script files and  documentation. It is true that there are existing R packages
which help in package  development  like devtools or roxygen2 but they are too
complicated and huge to do a simple package. The package devtools for instance,
installs around 60-80 other required  packages and required more than 400MB of
disk space if everything is installed. 

In contrast the __rsfp__  approach just needs a basic R  installation  and one
single  file, the  rsfp-src.R  script.  The  basic  procedure  to create a new
package based on the file __rsfp-src.R__ is to call the Rscript file with the 
`--new-package` argument like this.

```
Rscript rsfp-src.R --new-package sbi
```

This will create a file  `sbi-src.R` in the current  folder which is a copy of
the file  `rsfp-src.R`  but with all  appearances  of the string "rsfp" replaced
with the string "sbi" - the new package name string.
